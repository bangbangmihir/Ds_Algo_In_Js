// Sliding Window Problem Solving Approach => By Using This Approach We can Calculate LArgest Substring Having Unique Character
// or We can calculate maxsubArray i.e Maximum Sum of n consecutive Elements


// In This Approach We MAke Window And Move the Window Depending on the Various Condition
//=> This Pattern involves Creating a window which can be an array or number from one position to another
// Depending on a certain conditionthe window either increase or closes (and a new window created)
