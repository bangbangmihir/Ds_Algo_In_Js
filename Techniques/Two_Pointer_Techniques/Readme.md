The two-pointer technique is a powerful strategy in algorithm design, particularly useful when dealing with arrays and strings. It involves using two pointers to traverse the data structure, enabling efficient solutions to problems that might otherwise require nested loops.​

Key Concepts:

Opposite Directions: Pointers start at opposite ends of the data structure and move toward each other. This approach is effective for problems like finding pairs that sum to a target value or checking for palindromes.​

Same Direction (Fast-Slow Pointers): Both pointers start at the same position but move at different speeds. This method is commonly used in scenarios like removing duplicates from a sorted array or detecting cycles in linked lists.​

Applications:

Finding Pairs with a Target Sum: In a sorted array, two pointers can be used to find two numbers that add up to a specific target efficiently.​

Removing Duplicates: By using two pointers, you can overwrite duplicate elements in-place, resulting in optimized space usage.​

Palindrome Checking: Two pointers can verify if a string reads the same forward and backward by comparing characters from both ends toward the center.​

Advantages:

Efficiency: Reduces the need for nested loops, leading to time complexities of O(n) in many cases.​

Simplicity: Offers a straightforward approach to problems involving linear data structures.
