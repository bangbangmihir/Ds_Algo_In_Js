### Beginner-Level Problems:

1. Pair Sum in Sorted Array
Problem: Given a sorted array and a target sum, find if there exist two numbers that add up to the sum.

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target = 6  
Output: [1, 3]  # (2 + 4 = 6) 
```

2. Check if a String is a Palindrome
Problem: Given a string, check if it is a palindrome using two pointers.

```
Input: "madam"  
Output: True
```

3. Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array
Problem: Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place and return the new length.
```
Input: nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]  
Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

4. Merge Two Sorted Arrays

Problem: Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array using two-pointer approach.

```
Input: nums1 = [1, 3, 5], nums2 = [2, 4, 6]  
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

5. Move Zeroes to End

Problem: Given an array, move all zeroes to the end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

```
Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]  
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```

6. Reverse a String (In-Place)

Problem: Reverse a given string in-place using two pointers.

```
Input: "hello"  
Output: "olleh"
```

7. Square of a Sorted Array
Problem: Given a sorted array, return an array of the squares of each number, also sorted.

```
Input: [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]  
Output: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]
```

8. Find the Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays

Problem: Find common elements in two sorted arrays.

```
Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], nums2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]  
Output: [2, 4]
```



### Intermediate-Level Problems

1. Three Sum

Problem: Find all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero.

```
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]  
Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```

2. Container with Most Water

Problem: Find two heights that form a container that holds the most water.

```
Input: heights = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]  
Output: 49  # (Area between indices 1 and 8)
```
3. Valid Triangle Number

Problem: Given an array of side lengths, count the number of valid triangles.

```
Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 4]  
Output: 3
```

4. Partition Labels

Problem: Divide a string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

```
Input: "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"  
Output: [9,7,8]
```

### Hard-Level Problems

1. Trapping Rain Water

Problem: Given an elevation map, calculate how much water can be trapped.

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]  
Output: 6
```

2. Minimum Window Substring (Two-Pointer + Sliding Window)

Problem: Find the smallest window in a string s that contains all characters of t.

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"  
Output: "BANC"
```

3. Smallest Subarray with a Given Sum

Problem: Find the minimum length subarray with a sum greater than or equal to target

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3], target = 7  
Output: 2  # [4,3]
```
